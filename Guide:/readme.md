Tech Tip: 500 Microns = 500 Microns - East Coast Metal ...
A 500 micron vacuum is a vacuum level that's used to remove moisture and non-condensable gases from a system. It's a popular rule of thumb, but each system manufacturer has their own recommended pressure. 
How to measure a 500 micron vacuum 
Use a micron gauge to measure the vacuum level
Use a standard charging manifold, vacuum rated hoses, and valve core tools
Ensure the system is isolated and the vacuum has fully stabilized
Why 500 microns is important
A 500 micron vacuum is deep enough to boil off and remove all moisture and non-condensable gasses from a system 
At 500 microns, water boils at -12 degrees F 
If the system holds at 500 microns, it's considered dehydrated
